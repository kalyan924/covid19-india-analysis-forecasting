📈 Key Insights & Results
National Trend Analysis

Daily confirmed case patterns across all major waves

State-wise Epidemiological Findings

Maharashtra and Kerala recorded highest spread

Higher fatality in Delhi & Karnataka indicates healthcare stress

Testing Trend Observations

Testing capacity improved over time

Positivity spikes align with peak waves → insufficient testing

Healthcare Capacity Indicators

Cases per public hospital bed metric used

Bihar & UP showed severe resource pressure

Kerala & Karnataka handle burden better

Predictive Forecasting (SARIMA)

30-day forecast of daily confirmed cases

Useful for strategic preparedness & resource planning

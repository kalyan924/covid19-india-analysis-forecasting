📊 COVID-19 India Analysis and Forecasting
Comprehensive Epidemiological Data Analytics Project (India Focus)

This project presents a detailed analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic across India using real-world datasets. It covers national and state-wise spread, testing trends, healthcare resource capacity, and predictive forecasting to support data-driven decision-making.

🚀 Project Objectives

✔ Analyze epidemiological spread patterns
✔ Compare state-level COVID impact
✔ Examine testing growth & positivity trends
✔ Evaluate healthcare capacity vs disease burden
✔ Build forecasting models for future case trends
✔ Present insights through visual reports

Aligned with real-world pandemic response analytics.

📈 Key Insights & Visual Findings
🏁 National Spread Analysis

Daily confirmed cases plotted over entire pandemic timeline

Clear visualization of major COVID-19 waves in India

🌍 State-wise Epidemiological Insights

Maharashtra and Kerala lead in confirmed cases

Kerala shows strong recovery performance

Delhi & Karnataka exhibit higher fatality rates

🧪 Testing Trends & Public Health Response

Rapid increase in testing capacity over time

Positivity rate spikes align with major outbreak waves

Higher positivity → insufficient testing during peaks

🏥 Healthcare Capacity Indicators

Public beds analyzed per state

Case burden per bed used to measure healthcare strain

Bihar, UP & Delhi appear highly stressed

🔮 Predictive Forecasting (ARIMA Model)

SARIMA model used for next 30-day prediction

Supports early planning & resource management

Includes confidence-aware visualization
